# File-Monitoring-System

Random code generator will generate some random word at least 50% time and will generate pseudo words randomly.
Then it will write newly created words in two seperate files every 5 seconds.
other script file will read both newly created filey every 8 seconds and will count number of times specific word (which is generating at least 50% time by pseudo string generator).
Then it will log filename and the count related to files in specific format in log file.
We can also schedule this .py files to start running at startup of system by changing it to .pyw files.
